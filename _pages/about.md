## Who am I 

Greetings!

All the content in these pages is filled up by me - Vrinda Prabhu. I live in Bengaluru,India and fortunate to be involved in creating stuff using machine learning for a living.:slightly_smiling_face:

When I leave my ML sphere, I usually binge watch gameplays _(yup)_, indulge in vegetarian delicacies or strum random stuff on my guitar _(one more journey having many pit stops and re-starts)_. 

## Why this site

My day starts with me checking social networking sites for the latest in ML and code-in-ml. Of course, these are links to articles that I either read, procrastinate, or treasure. The main agenda of this site is to move the links _(from Excel, Google Sheets, Google Keep, Notepads, Bookmarks ...)_ to a central look-up space. 

Important, especially if the browser looks like below most of the times!
